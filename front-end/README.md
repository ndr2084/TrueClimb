# True Climbing Application

## Defining the App

### Primary purpose

To accurately track climbing progression over discrete intervals of time (day by day, training block by training block, and comparing training blocks against each other).

### Who is it for and what are they trying to accomplish?

It is for anyone from recreational climbers trying to better themselves in the sport of climbing, as well as advanced competitive climbers who are trying to track their progress and optimizie their performance.

### What is missing from existing solutions

[1] Current applications lack the granularity to differntiate between different types of climbing styles, and rely on the grades set by gyms too heavily. No app currently exists that allows users to differnatie between kilter board, moon board, slab, overhang, crimp, or comp climbs.

[2] Currently, climbers find belay partners either through discord chats, postings on gym bulletin boards, or approaching people in person. While all of these are fine methods, we believe that there are certain people who would rather find a partner through digital means; whether that be out of convenience, social anxiety, or vetting people online before meeting them in person.

### How will this app improve that experience?

[1] The application will offer a propriatary algorithm that can accurately gauge an athletes performance by considering RPE + actual gym grade + climbers perceivement of the grade. Additionally, the app will intellingently compare how other people rate standarzied climbs (kilter board, moon board, outdoor climbs) and normalize the data. A stretch goal would be to normalize the grades set by all gyms. since most people will visit more than one gym, we can compare their percievement of gyms they visit versus their home gym. The mission is to find a way to normalize all gym grades and remove the bias of "stiff gyms" and "soft gyms".

[2] When setting up the profile, the user will have the choice of making their profile findable or private. If their profie is findable, then other people who attend their gym will be at the top of their friend recommendations. People who climb at gyms closeby will appear lower on the list. For example; let gym A be the users current gym, with gym B being another gym close by, and gym C being another gym furthest away. Users at gym A will be ranked higher than users at gym B, who will rank higher than users at gym C.
